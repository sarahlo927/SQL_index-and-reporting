# SQL_assign6_index-and-reporting
1. Implement the database depicted above in SQL Server. After implementing the basic database structure (tables, attributes, keys, and relationships), consider the managerial reporting requirements described above and the sort of SQL queries that would be necessary to meet those requirements. Note: you do not actually need to write the SQL queries.

2. Add appropriate indexes to the tables in the database so that each of the reports listed above can be generated as quickly as possible. Note that SQL Server automatically adds indexes to primary key columns, so some indexes may have already been created for you.

3. Keep record of your indexing activities in a Microsoft Word document by:
  a) Describing each index in the database. Each index description should include:
  i. The name of the table to which the index applies
  ii. Whether the index is clustered or non-clustered
  iii. Whether the index is unique or non-unique
  iv. The name(s) of the index key column(s)
  v. The names of any additional (non index key) columns that are included in the index
  vi. Your rationale for why the index was included
  b) Include the SQL CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement associated with each index. Note: After implementing each index, you can view its associated CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement   by right-clicking on the index name in the Object Explorer, and then selecting Script Index As >> CREATE To >> New Query Editor Window.

To ensure that you receive credit for this assignment, please assemble your index descriptions and SQL CREATE or ALTER TABLE statements from Task 3 above into a single Word document. After creating your Word document, submit the file using the appropriate link on the course website.
